# Data Science: CSC-505_2018_Assignment

## "CSC 505 Data Science" is a UNCG Computer Science course I took that centers around a group project.  Independent of the group project, three individually graded assignments were due.

## This repository consists of those three assignments.

1. Assignment 1 Summary: 

   *"Goal: Create a ipython notebook of random team generator based on the .tsv file supplied. The program should be 
able to generate teams based on the number of teams provided as a variable."*

2. Assignment 2 Summary: 

   *Part 1) Based on the example Netflix viewership data, recommend a date-movie using the Python pandas library.  Use your own analysis and 
your best judgement.*

3. Assignment 3 Summary: 

   *Using the boston housing dataset, perform the following:*
   -   *Data understanding and preprocessing*
   -   *Create an Basic Linear Regression model using Sci-Kit (sklearn)*
